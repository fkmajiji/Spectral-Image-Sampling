# Spectral-Image-Sampling
You can use this code to spectral sample one standard reflectance HSI to one radiance HSI cube combined with illumination and cut off filter

You can run the "spectral_sampling_1.py" to generate one example image.

This code is based on the NTIRE2022_spectral: https://github.com/boazarad/NTIRE2022_spectral
