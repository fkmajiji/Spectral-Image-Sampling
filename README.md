# Spectral-Image-Sampling
You can use this code to spectrally sample one standard reflectance hyperspectral image to one radiance hyperspectral image combined with illumination and cut off filter

You can run the "spectral_sampling_1.py" to generate one example image.

This code is based on the NTIRE2022_spectral: https://github.com/boazarad/NTIRE2022_spectral.

For the 'Cloth3.mat' mentioned in the code, user can download it from http://www.ok.sc.e.titech.ac.jp/res/MSI/MSIdata59.html
